Programming assignment #3

1. chmod u+x install.sh

2. ./install.sh

3. When running the ./my_nids program, it is necessary to give permissions

using sudo.

4. In order to achieve a pleasant output, please specify the error stream file

when running the my_nids program (e.g. ./my_nids some_rule_file 2> errors.txt)

5. The program will find any suitable network adapter except lo to capture

packets and will display the device name in the beginning of running.
